/*  more Begriffserkl√§rung:
 *
 * 	in order to see how it works, it is best to open a e14 unit and see for oneself.
 *
 * 	in rough terms:
 *		the motor has a worm gear on its rotor.
 *		this worm gear rotates an idler gear which in turn rotates the "40-tooth e14 gear".
 *			the "40-tooth e14 gear" actuates the "17 tooth rohloff gear", which then does the actual shifting in the hub.
 *		the "40-tooth e14 gear" also drives the "23-tooth magnetic gear".
 *
 *	the "23-tooth magnetic gear" has a built-in magnet which rotation is detected by the as5601 encoder.
 *	the as5601 sits axially directly under this magnetic gear, on the inside of the e14 unit, on the PCB underside.
 *
 *	shifting e.g. one gear up makes the "23-tooth magnetic gear" rotate approx. (1/4 + 1/8 = 0.375 turn into CW.
 *		(looking at the unit's right side !!)
 *
 *	gear ratios of the worm, idler and even "40-tooth e14 gear" gears are irrelevant.
 *	relevant ratios are "17 tooth rohloff gear" to "23-tooth magnetic gear".
 *	this is 17/23 = 0.7391...
 *		for every full rotation of the 17-tooth gear, the 23-tooth gear makes 0.7391... revolutions
 *
 *		51.4285... degrees of rotation of the 17-tooth gear are:
 *			 (360/7) * (17/23) = 38.0124... degrees of rotation of the 23-tooth gear.
 *
 *		these 38.0124... degrees are what needs to be measured.
 *
 *		in as5601 terms, 38.0124... degrees are:
 *			- 38.0124... / 360 = 0.1055... rotations of 360 degrees (in decimal)
 *			- 1024 * 0.1055...  = 108.1242... impulses, with an ABM setting of 0x08
 *			- 4096  * 0.1055...  = 432.4968... raw degrees, as read from as5601 ANGLE register
 *
 *		fun fact: (360/7) * (17/23) / 360 == 17/161
 *
 *	the amount of overall error introduced through gear play is roughly 20 raw degrees or 5 pulses.
 *		the gears tend to return to their original position, so the raw angle value with no movement centers around the initial value, however the pulse count does increase and doesn't return to its original value.
 *
